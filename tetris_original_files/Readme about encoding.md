1. the original files are enconding by 'korean(page 949)'. the version changed into UTF-8 has been uploaded.
2. if you still tend to open a 'korean(page 949)'-type source file, open vs and click them in order: 
    - file-open-file-(tetris.c)-open(more)-connecting program-'C++ source code editor(using ENCODING)', then choose 'korean(page 949)' encoding type. 
    - it might be a bit different because translated from korean
3. make sure save files as 'UTF-8(with BOM)' and 'Windows(CR LF)'. every oversight could be a DISASTER for others.
    - you can use an extension named 'Force UTF-8(with BOM)' to help you. 
    - click: extension-extension_management-online, and search 'Force UTF-8(with BOM)', download, apply, restart vs.
